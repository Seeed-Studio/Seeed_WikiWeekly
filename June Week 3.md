![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/June%20Week%203/June-Week-3-logo.png)

Hello everyone! We hope everyone is staying safe from COVID-19 and wishing you all good health!
It's the third week of June and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach.  
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!

## New Wiki Added
 
### 1. Grove - AHT20 I2C Industrial Grade Temperature & Humidity Sensor

[Grove - AHT20 I2C Industrial Grade Temperature & Humidity Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-AHT20-I2C-Industrial-grade-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-p-4497.html) has been there on Bazaar for quite a while and now we bring you it's [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-AHT20-I2C-Industrial-Grade-Temperature&Humidity-Sensor/). This wiki will help you use this sensor along with a [Seeeduino Lotus V1.1](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Lotus-V1-1-ATMega328-Board-with-Grove-Interface.html) and obtain accurate temperature and humidity information quickly and easily!

### 2. Geppetto Guide for Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino 

If you don’t want to work on schematic or layout by yourself, but want to convert your prototype based on Seeed modules onto an integrated product, we highly recommend you to try Geppetto. We have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-for-Arduino-Geppetto-Guide/) on how to use Gepetto to add or remove modules to our Beginner Kit or even build your own Grove modules using our Seeed library on Geppetto with ease!


<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-for-Arduino-Geppetto-Guide/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Geppetto/wiki-01.png" alt="pir"  width="800" height="auto"></a></p>

 The beauty of Geppetto is that you don’t need to know about resistors, capacitors, inductors, routing paths or any advanced eletronics to design your own module. Geppetto is simply drag & drop and therefore anyone can create professional IoT devices!


### 3. How to bridge Mosiquitto MQTT Broker to AWS IoT with Arduino Boards?

Gateways are present both in industrial IoT environments and in connected home. We have prepared a [guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Arduino-AWS-IOT-Bridge/) using [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) to show you how to implement the Mosquitto Agent Bridge feature to enable the use of gateways through the MQTT messaging, setting up bi-directional data exchange with AWS IoT Core. This will allow your device to communicate locally with the Mosquitto Agent and AWS IoT Core to benefit from the power of AWS Cloud.

### 4. How to use an LTE module to transform your ODYSSEY-X86J4105 into a 4G Wi-Fi router?

[ODYSSEY - X86J4105](https://www.seeedstudio.com/tag/ODYSSEY-X86J4105.html) is a powerful Single Board Computer which has 4G cellular capabilities onboard. So by taking this into advantage, we have managed to convert this SBC into a 4G Wi-Fi router!
This is all possible by inserting a [Quectel EM06-E LTE Cat 6 M.2 Module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Quectel-EM06-E-LTE-Cat6-Module-p-4567.html) to the M.2 connector on the ODYSSEY - X86J4105 and inserting a SIM card.
We have prepared a [wiki guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4105-LTE-Module/) to help you easily set this up on your ODYSSEY - X864105 as well!
