Hello everyone! We hope everyone is staying safe from COVID-19 and wishing you all good health!
It's the first week of June and we are back with "Seeed Weekly Wiki Updates" as promised. This week was also filled with a lot of fun stuff at Seeed and we are happy to update you all with what we have done at Seeed Wiki. 
As you all know, Seeed Wiki is a dedicated platform where we provide the proper guidance and support you need when getting started with our products. We put a lot of effort to make this platform more user friendly because we want to enable the learning of electronics in a more systematic approach. 
We will bring you all these wiki updates in a weekly basis. So stay tuned with us and don't forget to visit this page again next week!


## Existing Wiki Updated

### 1. Use PlatformIO IDE For Arduino Programming

As you may have experienced, Arduino IDE may not be the best IDE for Arduino Programming when it comes to productivity. So we are excited to bring you PlatformIO support for [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) and [Seeeduino XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) to begin your programming in your favorite developing environment! 
We have written a  [step-by-step tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Software-PlatformIO/) on setting up PlatformIO to help you get started quickly and easily. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Software-PlatformIO/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/platformIO/platformIO.gif" alt="pir"  width="700" height="auto"></a></p>

PlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multi-framework professional IDE tool for embedded system and software engineers who write embedded applications. By providing a universal IDE interface using PlatformIO, you are able to program your hardware in a more developer-friendly way!

### 2. Firmata Usage On ODYSSEY - X86J4105

Want to control the Arduino Core present on the [ODYSSEY-X86J4105](https://www.seeedstudio.com/tag/ODYSSEY-X86J4105.html) by using different programming languages other than C++?
Firmata protocol is the solution. 
We have written a [wiki guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4105-Firmata/) to help you get started with Firmata on your ODYSSEY-X86J4105.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4105-Firmata/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/June%20Week%201/thumb.png" alt="pir" width="700" height="auto"></a></p>

Firmata is an intermediate protocol that connects an embedded system to a host computer, and the protocol channel uses a serial port by default. The Arduino platform is the standard reference implementation for Firmata. The Arduino IDE comes with the support for Firmata.



### 3. Ardupy Support For Grove - Analog Microphone

Wih the introduction of ArduPy along with the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html), we work hard to gradually bring you it's support to all the Grove Modules in the Grove Ecosystem. 
So in this week, we have added ArduPy support for our [Grove - Analog Microphone](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Analog-Microphone-p-4593.html) and prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Analog-Microphone/#play-with-wio-terminal) for you to get started with ArduPy using our Grove - Analog Microphone and Wio Terminal quickly and easily.

### 4. Read/Write Flash Storage On The Wio Terminal Using QSPI

As you all know, we already have read/write support for Micro-SD cards connected to the Wio Terminal. However, the onboard Flash Storage was unable to be tinkered with. This week, we have added read/write support for the onboard 4MB Flash on the Wio Terminal and have prepared a [tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-FS-ReadWrite/#readingwriting-the-flash-using-qspi) for it. So now you can access the onboard Flash using QSPI (Quad Serial Peripheral Interface).

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-FS-ReadWrite/#readingwriting-the-flash-using-qspi"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal/img/SFUD.png" alt="pir"  width="700" height="auto"></a></p>
